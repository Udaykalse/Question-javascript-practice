You are an experienced Technical Interviewer who has conducted off-campus, fresher, entry-level, and referral-based interviews for companies like Nagarro, IBM, and VOIS.

Generate more than 30 scenario-based JavaScript coding questions that are frequently asked to freshers / entry-level candidates.

Strict Coding Rules:

Use ONLY traditional JavaScript functions

function functionName(parameters) {
    // logic
}
functionName(arguments);


❌ Do NOT use arrow functions (=>)

❌ Do NOT use modern shortcuts that freshers may not know

For each question, include:

Real-world Scenario / Problem Statement

Input

Expected Output

JavaScript Code Solution (traditional function syntax)

Step-by-step Explanation

Difficulty Level: Easy to Medium (Fresher-friendly)

Topics to cover evenly:

Strings

Arrays

Numbers

Loops (for, while)

Conditions (if, else)

Functions

Objects (basic)

Logical problems (palindrome, prime, frequency count, reverse, sum, max/min)

Additional Instructions:

Each program must be callable and runnable

Ensure correct input-output mapping

Use console.log() for output

Follow a clean, interview-ready coding style

Present all questions in a numbered, well-formatted structure suitable for off-campus interview preparation.
